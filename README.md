# ðŸ“˜ Contact & Booking UI Automation with Playwright

##  Project Overview

This project automates user journey testing for the **Shady Meadows B&B** website using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), focusing on:
- Submitting messages via the Contact Us form
- Booking a room using the Booking form

The automation follows best practices using the **Page Object Model (POM)**, the **Faker.js** library for dynamic data, and includes logging and validation of key UI elements.

##  Testing Best Practices Used

###  Page Object Model (POM)
All locators and actions are encapsulated in dedicated page classes:
- `ContactPage.ts`
- `BookingPage.ts`

This ensures code reusability, clarity, and maintainability.

---

###  Data-Driven Testing
Randomised user data is generated using the `@faker-js/faker` package, which prevents test data collisions and simulates real-world input.

---

###  Console Logging
Each test step logs meaningful messages to the console using `console.log()` to improve test traceability and simplify debugging.

---

### Inline Waits & Assertions
- UI elements are waited on before interaction using `await page.waitForSelector` and `expect(...).toBeVisible()`
- Success messages are verified using `expect().toContain()` with actual values passed through from test input

---

### Clean Scroll & Visibility Checks
Smooth scrolling and `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` are used to ensure stable element interaction across various screen sizes.
